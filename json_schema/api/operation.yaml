Operation:
  description: The status of a long running operation.
  properties:
    path:
      type: string
      description:
        The server-assigned path, which is only unique within the same
        service that originally returns it.
    done:
      type: boolean
      description: >-
        If the value is false, it means the operation is still in progress.
        If true, the operation is completed, and either response or error
        is available.
    error:
      $ref: '#/components/schemas/Error'
    metadata:
      type: object
      description: >-
        Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically
        contains progress information and common metadata such as create time.
        Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a
        long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.
    response:
      type: object
      description: >-
        The normal response of the operation in case of success.
        Depending on the method, this may be the empty object, the resource on which
        the operation is performed, or a custom response.
