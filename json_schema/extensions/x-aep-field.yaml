    type: array
    items:
      enum:
        # Denotes a field as immutable.
        # This indicates that the field may be set once in a request to create a
        # resource, but may not be changed thereafter.
        - "IMMUTABLE"
        # Denotes a field as input only.
        # This indicates that the field is provided in requests, and the
        # corresponding field is not included in output.
        - "INPUT_ONLY"
  resource_reference:
    description: |
      The resource type that the annotated field references.

      Example:
        "library.example.com/topic"

      Occasionally, a field may reference an arbitrary resource. In this case,
      APIs use the special value "*" in their resource reference.

    type: array
    items: string
